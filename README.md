##Sidekiq demo 

This is a simple example of using Sidekiq. 
In addition to the regular Sidekiq setup (e.g. have a running instance of Redis), first thing you'll need to do in order to run this app is set up an account on [Filepicker](http://www.filepicker.io).

Then, plug in your API into config/application.rb
